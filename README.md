[STORYBOOK](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/)

Storybook is an open-source development tool that allows you to develop and test user interface (UI) components in isolation, without having to integrate them into your main application. Here are some of the things Storybook does:

Isolated component visualization: It enables you to develop and visualize components independently, without the need to integrate them into your main application. This facilitates component development and debugging, as you can work on them in isolation.
Creating stories: Storybook allows you to define "stories" for your components, where you can showcase different states and variations of a component. This is useful for testing different use cases and states of a component.
Interacting with components: You can interact with components in Storybook, enabling you to test their functionality and behavior interactively.
Support for multiple frameworks and technologies: Storybook is compatible with a wide range of front-end frameworks and technologies, including React, Vue, Angular, HTML, CSS, and more. This makes it a versatile tool that adapts to different technological stacks.
Integration with development tools: Storybook integrates with other development tools, such as testing tools, version control, and component libraries, making the development workflow seamless.
In summary, Storybook is a powerful tool for UI component development, allowing you to develop, test, and visualize components in isolation and effectively. This helps improve the quality, consistency, and reusability of components in your applications.
